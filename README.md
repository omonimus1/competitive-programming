# Competitive-programming

The current repository contains a set of learning resources, and coding challenges solutions that I have implemented as result of my training, to ace a Big Tech interview that allowed me to receive an offer at Microsoft for a SWE intern role. 
NOT everything you may read in this repository is the overall knowledge requierd during an algorithms and data-structures round, but I have started from zero, just like you, and from zero to half-hero, almost everything produced or needed has been shared in this repository.

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repository
2. Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
3. Make a pull request

## When contribute
1. If there is no solution to a problem in the main branch.
2. If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.
3. If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size. In this case, comment out the original solution and make a pull request with your solution.
4. If you have another method of solving the problem which is asymptotically slower than the original method then, comment your solution in the main file and make a pull request.
5. If you would like to make any positive change to the lectures content

## I appreciate any feedback
Constructive criticisms or code reviews of any kind are very much welcome.
